# INTRODUCTION

This is the webpage for the lecture series on Data Analysis and Statistics at the LHC. In these pages, you can find links to the lectures as well as exercises for you to explore a typical data analysis at CMS. 

## Useful Links 

You can find more useful information about the software we will be using below 

  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker is a desktop client for running the container images that we will be using for these exercises.  
  * [CMS Open Data](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/): The CMS Collaboration regularly releases open datasets for public use. This link is the CMS Open Data Guide
  * [Combine](https://cms-analysis.github.io/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/latest/): The Combine tool is the main statistical analysis software package used by the CMS Collaboration. It is based on the ROOT/RooFit software packages, however for these exercises, you do not need to be an expert user of these packages.
