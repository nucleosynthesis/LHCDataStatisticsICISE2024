# Exercise 1 - Maximum Likelihood Fits 

From yesterday's exercise, we now have a set of histograms, from data and simulation, in our `.csv` file. Don't worry if you didn't manage to run over all of the samples from yesterday, you can use the pre-prepared file `ttbarAnalysis/exercise1solutions/signalregion_mbjj.csv`.

In today's exercise 

=== "C"

    ``` c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      printf("Hello world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

=== "C++"

    ``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
