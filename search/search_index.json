In these pages, you can find links to the lectures as well as exercises for you to explore a typical data analysis at CMS. Useful Links You can find more useful information about the software we will be using below Docker : Docker is a desktop client for running the container images that we will be using for these exercises. CMS Open Data : The CMS Collaboration regularly releases open datasets for public use. This link is the CMS Open Data Guide Combine : The Combine tool is the main statistical analysis software package used by the CMS Collaboration. It is based on the ROOT/RooFit software packages, however for these exercises, you do not need to be an expert user of these packages. About the Author Dr. Nicholas Wardle is a lecturer in Physics at Imperial College London. He is also a member of the CMS Collaboration and his research is focused on statistical methods for data analysis and searches for BSM physics through precision measurements of Higgs boson properties.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This is the webpage for the lecture series on Data Analysis and Statistics at the LHC.
